# Mobile Application Testing – Finance App

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates manual testing of a mobile finance application that allows users to manage accounts (wallets), track income and expenses, and control balances.

The goal of this project is to showcase practical QA skills, including test planning, test case design, bug reporting, and analytical thinking.

## Scope of Testing

The following features were tested:
* User registration
* Login/Logout
* Initial account setup
* Account (wallet) management
* Income and expense transactions
* Balance calculation and display

## Testing Types
* Functional testing
* UI testing
* Exploratory testing
* Boundary value testing

## Test Documentation
This repository contains:
* Test Plan
* Test Cases
* Bug Report

## Identified Defects
* When adding transactions with decimal values (e.g. 100.50), the transaction amount is displayed correctly
* The total account balance is rounded on main screens
* The exact balance is shown only on the account edit screen
This behavior may lead to user confusion in a finance-related application

* Device: Realme GT6 (physical device)
* Application Version: 1.8.10

## Key QA Skills Demonstrated
* Writing structured test plans
* Designing clear and reusable test cases
* Identifying and documenting real-world bugs
* Understanding financial application logic
* Linking test cases with defects
* Clear and professional documentation
